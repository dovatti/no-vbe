Not Only Visual Basic Editor is a free and open source set of libraries that allows you to code your Visual Basic for Office Applications on your favourite text-editor!

This project is possible thanks to the implementation of [VBA-Web](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Web) in it.

This project is currently under maintainment and construction. Soon will be published source code and'll be possible to try it out.
